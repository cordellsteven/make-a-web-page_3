    <p>Knowing how the internet works in conjunction with my computer is handy when learning to think about coding.

            <b> HTML</b>
            <br><em>HTML</em> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard for all documents for webpages
            <br>This language is responsible for what the web page "looks like." Some good references include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_links.aspâ€‹url">HTML Links</a>

              <b>inline</b>-simple line breaks. Think in terms of "return" on a keyboard.

              <b>block</b>-invisible box around the text of the element like a text box in a powerpoint slide <a href="http://www.free-power-point-templates.com/sample-powerpoint-presentation/">case in <em>point</em></a>

              <br> Computer are dumb, but not ignorant. Simply a computer can only do what it is told by the programmer. Knowing what to tell the computer was the hardest part of this project.

                  HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
                  <br> In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

                </p>
                <p>
                  When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

                </p>
                <p>
                  When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

                <b>Avoiding Repetition</b>
              </div>
              <p>
                Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code
                (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson the same and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By
                avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
              </p>
              <div class="basic" id="lesson-3-2">
                <b>CSS</b>
              </div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <p>
                  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
